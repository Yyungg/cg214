        <h1>Bold Color</h1>
        <p>Henri Matisse is a French painter that used bright colours to paint vibrant landscapes but he is best known for his paper cut out pieces. Matisse would use scissors to cut colored paper into flowers and people. His work inspires me through his graphic and bold style. When you look at my designs you can see a clear similarity of his simplistic style.  </p>
        
        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>The first time I was inspired by Matisee was when the Metropolitan Museum exhibited "Henri Matisee: The Cut-Outs" I loved the use of his primary colors and graphic flat style. I decided to use his style for my screen printing projects.</p>
